#####mario.c
Write, in a file called ```mario.```, a program that recreates this half-pyramid using hashes (```#```) for blocks. However, to make things more interesting, first prompt the user for the half-pyramid’s height, a non-negative integer no greater than ```23```. (The height of the half-pyramid pictured above happens to be ```8```.) If the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than ```23```, you should re-prompt for the same again. Then, generate (with the help of ```printf``` and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid. Take care to align the bottom-left corner of your half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window, as in the sample output below, wherein underlined text represents some user’s input. 
Example:
```
How tall would you like your tower?
8  
       ##  
      ###  
     ####  
    #####  
   ######  
  #######  
 ########  
#########  
```

#####greedy.c
How few? Well, you tell us. Write, in a file called ```greedy.c```, a program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then spits out the minimum number of coins with which said change can be made. We ask that your program’s last line of output be only the minimum number of coins possible: an integer followed by ```\n```. Example: 
```
O hai! How much change is owed?
0.41
4
```
